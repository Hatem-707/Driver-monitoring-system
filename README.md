# üöó Real-Time Driver Monitoring System (DMS)

A real-time Driver Monitoring System that detects **drowsiness** and **distracted behaviors** using deep learning, applies temporal rules to avoid false alarms, and provides **visual and audio alerts** to improve driving safety.

## üìå Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the DEPI training program.  
It aims to:
- Detect **driver drowsiness** using CNN/MobileNetV2.
- Detect **distraction behaviors** (phone use, smoking, eating, etc.).
- Apply **temporal rules** to avoid missclassifying blinking with drowsiness.
- Provide **visual & sound alerts** in real-time on webcam feed.
- Log all events (drowsiness, distractions) (Optinoal feature).

## üñºÔ∏è Final Interface
- **Live Webcam Feed** ‚Äì Shows real-time detection.
- **Status Panel** ‚Äì Displays current driver state (Drowsy, Alert, Distracted).
- **Alerts** ‚Äì Visual (red border/text) + Audio (buzzer/beep)(optional).
- **Logging System** ‚Äì Saves `.csv` file after each session with(optional):
  - Timestamp of events
  - Event type (Drowsy/Distraction)
  - Duration of event
  - Alert triggered (Yes/No)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **Python** (TensorFlow / OpenCV / NumPy / Pandas)
- **MobileNetV2 / CNN** for detection
- **Matplotlib/ Seaborn** for visualizations
- **PyAudio / Playsound** for audio alerts (Optional)
- **CSV / Pandas** for logging system (Optional)

## Work Snapshot
- A baseline model using **YOLO11s-cls** on **DDD**: https://www.kaggle.com/code/hatemfeckry/notebookd991b7d722
    - **Conculsion**: The model demonstarted that the dataset is exteremely simple and a pretrained light weight model managed to achieve almost perfect classification accuracy in only two epochs.
    - **Future Direction**: Find a more complex dataset with varied scenes and different lighting conditions.
